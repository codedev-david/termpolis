> **A note on AI-assisted development:** There may be critique that this application is built in conjunction with using AI; however, if you are still exclusively using an IDE or manually writing every line of code, then you are doing it wrong. This is the new path for AI-native engineering as a programmer. Code review is often still needed, but beyond this, software engineering has a new path. Termpolis itself is built with AI and built *for* AI workflows — and that's the point.

## Features

### Terminal Management
- **Multi-terminal sessions** — open as many terminals as you need in one window
- **Tab View** — single terminal at a time, switch via sidebar
- **Split View** — split any terminal horizontally or vertically with draggable dividers
- **Nested splits** — split panes recursively for complex layouts (like VS Code or iTerm2)
- **Workspaces** — save and restore terminal configurations including names, shells, themes, and working directories
- **Session persistence** — terminals, workspaces, and settings auto-restore on relaunch
- **Single-instance lock** — only one Termpolis window runs at a time to prevent session conflicts
- **Drag and drop** — drag files onto a terminal to paste their quoted file paths

### Shell Support
- **PowerShell**, **Bash**, **Zsh**, **Cmd**, **Git Bash** — auto-detected per OS
- **Shell config editor** — edit .bashrc, .zshrc, PowerShell profiles with Monaco Editor

### AI-Native Features
- **AI Session Profiles** — one-click launch profiles for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Aider with custom profiles support
- **Command Palette** — `Ctrl+K` opens a natural language command bar to control the app (new terminal, split panes, launch agents, run commands)
- **Prompt Templates** — save reusable prompt snippets (Fix Tests, Code Review, Refactor, etc.) and insert them with `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- **Multi-Agent Workflow Templates** — pre-built split-pane layouts for common AI workflows (Claude + Shell, Full Stack Dev, Code Review)
- **Agent Status Detection** — automatically detects when Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or Aider is running and shows a colored badge in the status bar
- **Cost Tracking** — parses token usage and cost from AI agent output, displays running totals in the status bar
- **Session Recording** — record terminal sessions with timestamps, export as shareable text logs
- **Output Pinning** — pin important output blocks to a persistent panel that stays visible as the terminal scrolls
- **Diff Viewer** — detects `git diff` output and renders it with syntax highlighting (green/red for additions/deletions)
- **Smart Context Panel** — `Ctrl+Shift+E` opens a side panel showing file tree, git status, and recent commits for the current directory
- **Conversation History** — `Ctrl+Shift+I` searches across all AI agent conversations indexed from terminal output

### MCP Server & Agent Integration
- **MCP Server** — built-in HTTP/SSE server on `localhost:9315` with 14 tools for AI agents to control terminals programmatically
- **Auto-registers with Claude Code** — on launch, Termpolis injects itself into `~/.claude/settings.json` so Claude Code can use it as an MCP server immediately. Zero configuration needed.
- **Stdio Adapter** — for agents that use stdio-based MCP, a standalone adapter script proxies to the HTTP server
- **CLI Tool** — `termpolis-cli` lets you control Termpolis from any terminal (`list`, `create`, `run`, `read`, `close`, `files`, `git`)
- **Auth Token** — 256-bit random token per launch, required on all endpoints. Localhost only, CORS restricted.

### Context Handoff
- **Seamless agent switching** — when an AI agent runs out of context/tokens, an amber banner offers to switch to another agent
- **Automatic context capture** — captures your task, git branch, modified files, recent commands, diff summary, and recent output
- **One-click handoff** — click "Switch to Codex" (or Gemini/Aider) to launch the new agent with your full context pre-loaded
- **Editable handoff prompt** — preview and customize the context before switching via the "More Options" modal
- **Keep or close** — choose whether to keep the old terminal for reference or close it

### Multi-Agent Swarm

No AI company has built a tool that brings together competing models to work as a team — because it helps their competitors. Termpolis does it anyway, because it moves AI forward.

- **Smart Task Routing** — the orchestrator analyzes your task description, breaks it into subtasks (refactoring, testing, docs, review, etc.), and assigns each to the best agent based on a capability matrix. Scores are transparent (0-100) with human-readable reasons explaining every assignment. Token-heavy work is routed to cheaper agents for cost efficiency. Every assignment can be manually overridden.

  | Capability | Claude Code | Codex | Gemini CLI | Aider+Qwen |
  |-----------|:-----------:|:-----:|:----------:|:----------:|
  | Refactoring | ★★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
  | Testing | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★ |
  | Documentation | ★★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★ |
  | Code Review | ★★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★ |
  | DevOps/Infra | ★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ | ★★ |
  | Bulk Tasks | ★★★ | ★★★★ | ★★★ | ★★★★★ |
  | Token Cost | $$$$ | $$$ | $$ | Free |

- **Swarm Orchestrator** — 4-step wizard: pick agents → describe task → review smart-routed assignments with scores and token budget → launch. Each agent gets a split pane with their optimized task.
- **Token Budget Estimates** — shows per-agent estimated tokens and cost before you launch, so you know what the swarm will cost
- **Swarm Dashboard** — `Ctrl+Shift+S` opens real-time view of agents (health status), tasks (kanban columns), and messages
- **Message Bus** — agents communicate through a shared message queue with typed messages (task, result, question, info, review)
- **Task Queue** — create tasks, assign to agents, track status across Pending → In Progress → Completed
- **Agent Bridge** — agents without native MCP (e.g., Aider) are automatically bridged via terminal output parsing. Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI all use MCP natively.
- **6 swarm MCP tools** — `swarm_send_message`, `swarm_read_messages`, `swarm_create_task`, `swarm_list_tasks`, `swarm_update_task`, `swarm_list_agents`
- **Free local option** — Aider + Qwen3-Coder runs via Ollama with zero API cost. Auto-detects if Ollama is installed.

### Intelligence
- **Command autocomplete** — VS Code-style dropdown with command names, subcommands, and flags. Bundled specs for 20+ common tools (git, docker, npm, kubectl, curl, and more)
- **Command auto-fix** — mistype a command? A green banner suggests the correction. Press Enter to run or Esc to ignore. Detects typos, permission errors, wrong flags, and more
- **Command history search** — search across all terminals with Ctrl+Shift+H

### Customization
- **7 terminal themes** — Dark, Light, Solarized Dark, Solarized Light, Monokai, Dracula, Nord
- **Per-terminal theming** — each terminal can have its own theme, font size (8-32px), and font family
- **Color-coded terminals** — 12 accent colors for visual identification in the sidebar
- **Configurable keybindings** — customizable keyboard shortcuts with a recording UI in Settings
- **Collapsible sidebar** — toggle with Ctrl+B or the chevron button

### Productivity
- **Terminal output export** — save scrollback to a text file (full or visible portion) via header button or right-click
- **Copy/paste** — Ctrl+Shift+C/V with right-click context menu (Copy, Paste, Select All)
- **Clickable URLs** — links in terminal output open in your default browser
- **Per-terminal status bar** — blue bar showing shell type, current directory, git branch, AI agent badge, and cost tracking
- **Live git branch detection** — status bar updates by parsing prompt output (works on all platforms)

### Built-in Tools
- **jq**, **yq**, and **nano** — bundled and available in every terminal, even if not installed on your system
- Latest versions downloaded automatically on each build

### Performance & Reliability
- **Output throttling** — rAF-based batching with 64KB per-frame rate limit prevents UI freezing from heavy output
- **10,000-line scrollback buffer** per terminal (prevents unbounded memory growth)
- **Viewport-aware rendering** — off-screen terminals in split view get deferred rendering
- **Lazy-loaded settings** — Monaco editor and settings pane load on demand, not at startup
- **Full Unicode support** — emoji, CJK characters, and special glyphs render correctly
- **React ErrorBoundary** — catches render crashes gracefully with a recovery UI instead of white screen of death. Terminals survive UI errors.
- **Sentry crash reporting** (optional) — set `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_DSN` env vars to enable. Strips PII, redacts paths. Disabled by default.
- **164 automated tests** — 89 unit (Vitest) + 75 E2E (Playwright) with 55 screenshots

### Cross-Platform
- **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux** — all features work on all platforms
- Builds via GitHub Actions CI/CD on tag push

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+K` | Command palette |
| `Ctrl+Shift+T` | New terminal |
| `Ctrl+Shift+W` | Close terminal |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next terminal |

> On macOS, use `Cmd` instead of `Ctrl`.

## MCP Server

Termpolis runs an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server on `localhost:9315` that AI agents can connect to via HTTP/SSE.

### Claude Code Integration

Termpolis **auto-registers** with Claude Code on launch — it adds itself to `~/.claude/settings.json` so Claude Code sees it as an MCP server immediately. No manual configuration needed.

### Available Tools (14)

**Terminal Management:**

### CLI Tool

Control Termpolis from any terminal without the MCP protocol:

```bash
termpolis-cli health                    # Check if MCP server is running
termpolis-cli list                      # List all open terminals
termpolis-cli create "Dev" bash         # Create a new terminal
termpolis-cli run <id> "npm test"       # Run a command in a terminal
termpolis-cli read <id> 20              # Read last 20 lines of output
termpolis-cli close <id>                # Close a terminal
termpolis-cli files ~/projects          # List files at a path
termpolis-cli git ~/projects/myapp      # Get git status
```

### Authentication

The MCP server requires a Bearer token on all endpoints except `/health`. A random token is generated on each app launch and written to:

| Platform | Token file |
|----------|-----------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\termpolis\mcp-token` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/termpolis/mcp-token` |
| Linux | `~/.config/termpolis/mcp-token` |

```bash
# Read token and make an authenticated request
TOKEN=$(cat ~/.config/termpolis/mcp-token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:9315/mcp \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}'
```

### Health Check (no auth required)

```bash
curl http://localhost:9315/health
# {"status":"ok","name":"termpolis-mcp","version":"1.2.0","tools":8,"auth":"required"}
```

## Security

Termpolis takes security seriously, especially with AI agent integration.

### MCP Server Security
- **Localhost only** — bound to `127.0.0.1`, never exposed to the network
- **Auth token required** — random 256-bit token generated on each app launch, required via `Authorization: Bearer` header on all endpoints except health check
- **CORS restricted** — no wildcard origins, preventing browser-based CSRF attacks
- **Token file permissions** — `600` (owner read/write only) on macOS/Linux; per-user `%APPDATA%` on Windows

### Application Security
- **Single-instance lock** — prevents session data corruption from multiple windows
- **Context isolation** — Electron's `contextIsolation: true` with `nodeIntegration: false`, all main process access via secure `contextBridge`
- **No remote code execution** — no `eval()`, no remote module loading, no `webSecurity` bypasses
- **Bundled tools verified** — jq, yq, and nano downloaded from official GitHub releases only

### No Plugin System — By Design
- Termpolis intentionally does **not** have a plugin or extension system
- Third-party plugins are a major attack surface — they run with full app permissions, can access terminals, read output, and execute commands
- Every feature in Termpolis is built-in, auditable, and ships with the app
- If you need custom behavior, fork the repo — the codebase is open source and well-documented

### What Users Should Know
- Terminal sessions run with your user permissions — same as any terminal application
- AI agents launched through profiles (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) have the same access as if you ran them manually
- The MCP token rotates on every app restart — a compromised token becomes invalid when you close the app
- No telemetry, no analytics, no cloud accounts — everything stays on your machine

### Session Persistence

Session data is stored as JSON in the Electron `userData` directory:
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/termpolis/session.json`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/termpolis/session.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/termpolis/session.json`

Saved state includes: terminals, workspaces with working directories, default shell, view mode, keybindings, AI profiles, and prompt templates.

Old sessions are automatically migrated — missing fields receive defaults on load.
